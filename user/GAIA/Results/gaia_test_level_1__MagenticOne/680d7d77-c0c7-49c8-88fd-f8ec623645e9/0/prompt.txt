The attached file shows a list of titles owned by Scribe County Public Library. The library charges a flat rate of $3 for each item that is overdue. Assuming that everybody with an overdue library book will eventually return it and pay the fee, how many dollars of revenue can the library expect to see from overdue Adult and Young Adult books, and not including books marked as Science Fiction? Please provide your response as an integer value with no dollar sign.
