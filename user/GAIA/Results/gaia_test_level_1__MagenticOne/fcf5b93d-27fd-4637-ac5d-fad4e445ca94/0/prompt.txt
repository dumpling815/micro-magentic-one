I wanted to make another batch of cherry melomel. I remember liking the last recipe I tried, but I can't remember it off the top of my head. It was from the Reddit, r/mead. I remember that the user who made it had a really distinct name, I think it was StormBeforeDawn. Could you please look up the recipe for me? I'm not sure if it has been changed, so please make sure that the recipe you review wasn't updated after July 14, 2022. That's the last time I tried the recipe.

What I want to know is how many cherries I'm supposed to use. I'm making a 10-gallon batch in two 5-gallon carboys. Please just respond with the integer number of pounds of whole cherries with pits that are supposed to be used for a 10-gallon batch.
