The attached Excel file contains a record of the animals living at the San Cecelia Zoo. Specifically, it lists the type of animal, the number the zoo has, its location in the zoo, additional remarks from the zookeeper, and the date that type of animal was added to the zoo. What percentage of the zoo’s meerkats were above ground when the file was created? Use a decimal format, like 0.1 for 10%.
